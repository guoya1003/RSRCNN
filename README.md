if any question, send your e-mial to yananwei@buaa.edu.cn

Requirements:
--------------------------------------------
####Linux 14.04
####opencv 2.4.10
####python 2.7.6
####gcc 4.8.4
####g++ 4.8.4
####cmake 2.8.10
####caffe-future


Dataset:
---------------------------------------------
You can found the dataset(Massachusetts Roads Dataset) [here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/%7Evmnih/data/.).  Note that we followed MnihThesis to divide those 1,171 aerial
images into training (1,108 images), validation (14 images) and test sets (49 images).
(After observing the dateset, you may find that there exist some images which has partial mismatched groundtruth. 
It is because the Massachusetts Roads Dataset is used to study the effectiveness of the robust in [MnihThesis's work](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/%7Evmnih/docs/Mnih_Volodymyr_PhD_Thesis.pdf).
Therefore, you have to discard some samples after splitting.)

Experiment:
---------------------------------------------
###Install Caffe-future

You should use the Caffe-future source files provided, since the cross-entropy loss layer has been changed to obtain a road-structure-based loss in the caffe-future version which is provided by us. You can refer to the [setup guide](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/install_apt.html) to install caffe(Note that using cuda can speed up training and you needn't to 'make runtest' when install Caffe-future.). 

###Create Dataset
* Make your own groudtruth for training images, you can use Compute.m provide by us.<br>
* Segmente each image, in training, validation and test sets, into 16 non-overlapping 375Ã— 375 images. And then discard partial mismatched samples. <br>
* Shuffle the training set and develop the .txt files containing all the names and labels of images in the  training set (FindList.sh is referable to do this work, but you shuold replace the DEST_PATH with you own path by which you can find your images and by change the munber after "echo", you can get appropriate files depth. Anyway FindList.sh is juet an example).<br>
* Using the .txt files to develop the lmdb files. MakeLmdb.sh can finish this work (also note that you just need to replace the path with yours).<br>
* Develop the mean.binaryproto files by applying MakeMean.sh .<br>

###Training

Please using the upload caffe-future to train model
